# Relink

Jump over paywalls using Facebook re-linking.

It works on many newspaper sites like like wsj.com or ft.com. Facebook is generating signed url that gets through you paywalls. Simple. Few lines of code.

PS. Remember that Facebook is toxic for democracy. But so is uninformed citizen. Make your own choice.
