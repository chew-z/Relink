# Relink

Jump over paywalls with this simplistic Chrome extension using Facebook re-linking. You will find the link in context menu under a cursor ('Open via facebook...').

It works on many newspaper sites like like wsj.com or ft.com. Facebook is generating signed url that gets you through paywalls. Simple. Few lines of code.

PS. Remember that Facebook is toxic for democracy. But so is uninformed citizen. Make your own choice.
